[32;1m[1;3mSystem: You are an expert at reformulating educational queries for better retrieval from course materials.
When initial retrieval quality is poor, generate alternative queries that might yield better results.
Keep the queries closely related to the original intent and topic.
Human: Original Query: What was covered in yesterday's lesson?

Initial Results Quality Score: 0.49783639609797525
Quality Issues: Low similarity scores

The original query didn't match well with the course materials. Generate 3 alternative query formulations that:
1. Use different terminology or perspectives while staying on the same topic
2. Are more specific or break down the concept
3. Focus on different aspects of the SAME topic as the original query

IMPORTANT: 
- Keep all alternative queries closely related to the original query's topic
- Generate CONCRETE queries without placeholders or brackets
- If the query mentions "yesterday" or "recent", rephrase to be about "recent topics" or "latest materials"

Format each query on a new line starting with "QUERY:".

Example for "What was covered in yesterday's lesson?":
QUERY: recent topics covered in class
QUERY: latest lecture materials and concepts
QUERY: most recent course content and examples[0m

1.5) Cache Design

- the 3C model of cache misses:

Compulsory - the first time a block is accessed

Capacity - the cache is too small (a block gets replaced because the cache is full and then is needed again later)
eg 4 line fully associative cache
access pattern = B0, B1, B2, B3, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

Conflict - due to sharing a set (wouldn't miss if the cache was fully associative)
eg 4 line direct-mapped cache
access pattern = B0, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

- design parameters ABCs: Associativity, Block size, Capacity

4.5) Interrupt-Driven I/O

① write handler
② load handler address into mtvec
③ enable IRQs at the device
④ enable interrupts at the processor (via PLIC and mstatus)
⑤ run the application
⑥ when the device asserts an IRQ, the interrupt hardware runs the handler

# Processor Design

1) Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture [4.1]

- we will design a processor that executes instructions in 1 (long) clock cycle

- steps:
    ① instruction fetch + increment PC
    ② instruction decoding + prepare operands
    ③ ALU operation (arithmetic, logic, shift)
    ④ memory operation (load or store)
    ⑤ write to the destination register

- representative instructions
    lw (I-type)
    sw (S-type)
    add, sub, and, or (R-type)
    beq (B-type)

[Source 3] (Relevance: 0.51)
. The second bullet point mentions that compilers use x3/gp, x4/tp, and x8/fp. The third bullet point provides an example: if square() used t0 and t1 instead of s2 and s3, it wouldn't need to push and pop their contents. To the right of the third bullet point, there is a handwritten code snippet showing variable assignments and function calls.]

5) Performance

- the ideal CPI is 1 for a scalar pipeline
- hazards increase CPI by stalling or squashing instructions

- consider this dynamic instruction mix for a program

[Diagram: A table with 5 columns labeled "lw", "sw", "r-type", "beq", "j". The rows below the headers show percentages: "25%", "10%", "40%", "15%", "10%".]

- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent r-type (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent beq (2 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 r-type is followed by a dependent beq (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 3 beq are taken (1 instr. squashed)

- what is the average CPI?

[Source 5] (Relevance: 0.51)
- offset is a multiple of halfwords
- it is always even so imm[0] is always 0
imm [20:1]

# 11) Nested Functions Calls

- when a function calls another function (with jal x1, offset) its return address is overwritten
- it must therefore preserve ra/x1 to the stack first and restore it after

eg. a function that sums the squares of array elements

```c
int sumsquares (int array[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int *ptr = array;
    int *end = array + n; // & array[n];
    while (ptr != end) {
        int val = *ptr; // array[i]
        int sqval = square(val); // see earlier notes
        sum += sqval;
        ptr++; // advance to next element
    }
    return sum;
}
```

[Source 8] (Relevance: 0.50)
- The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

For r-type: "need source operand in" is EX, "value is produced in" is EX, "forward from" is ME or WB.
For lw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), "value is produced in" is ME, "forward from" is WB.
For sw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), ME(rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.
For beq: "need source operand in" is ID(rs1, rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.

2025-09-08 01:09:36,648 - langgraph.service.critic - INFO -    - context: [Source 1]: 1.5) Cache Design

- the 3C model of cache misses:

Compulsory - the first time a block is accessed

Capacity - the cache is too small (a block gets replaced because the cache is full and then is needed again later)
eg 4 line fully associative cache
access pattern = B0, B1, B2, B3, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

Conflict - due to sharing a set (wouldn't miss if the cache was fully associative)
eg 4 line direct-mapped cache
access pattern = B0, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

- design parameters ABCs: Associativity, Block size, Capacity

[Source 2]: 4.5) Interrupt-Driven I/O

① write handler
② load handler address into mtvec
③ enable IRQs at the device
④ enable interrupts at the processor (via PLIC and mstatus)
⑤ run the application
⑥ when the device asserts an IRQ, the interrupt hardware runs the handler

# Processor Design

1) Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture [4.1]

- we will design a processor that executes instructions in 1 (long) clock cycle

- steps:
    ① instruction fetch + increment PC
    ② instruction decoding + prepare operands
    ③ ALU operation (arithmetic, logic, shift)
    ④ memory operation (load or store)
    ⑤ write to the destination register

- representative instructions
    lw (I-type)
    sw (S-type)
    add, sub, and, or (R-type)
    beq (B-type)

[Source 3]: . The second bullet point mentions that compilers use x3/gp, x4/tp, and x8/fp. The third bullet point provides an example: if square() used t0 and t1 instead of s2 and s3, it wouldn't need to push and pop their contents. To the right of the third bullet point, there is a handwritten code snippet showing variable assignments and function calls.]

5) Performance

- the ideal CPI is 1 for a scalar pipeline
- hazards increase CPI by stalling or squashing instructions

- consider this dynamic instruction mix for a program

[Diagram: A table with 5 columns labeled "lw", "sw", "r-type", "beq", "j". The rows below the headers show percentages: "25%", "10%", "40%", "15%", "10%".]

- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent r-type (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent beq (2 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 r-type is followed by a dependent beq (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 3 beq are taken (1 instr. squashed)

- what is the average CPI?

[Source 5]: - offset is a multiple of halfwords
- it is always even so imm[0] is always 0
imm [20:1]
- jump offset range = [-2^20, +2^20 - 1] ~= ± 1 MiB

---

# 11) Nested Functions Calls

- when a function calls another function (with jal x1, offset) its return address is overwritten
- it must therefore preserve ra/x1 to the stack first and restore it after

eg. a function that sums the squares of array elements

```c
int sumsquares (int array[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int *ptr = array;
    int *end = array + n; // & array[n];
    while (ptr != end) {
        int val = *ptr; // array[i]
        int sqval = square(val); // see earlier notes
        sum += sqval;
        ptr++; // advance to next element
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Big-endian column:
Address 0: 12
Address 1: 34

To the right of the big-endian column are labels: M68000, network, ARM.]

- memory accesses are "naturally aligned" if the address is a multiple of the data size

[Source 7]: return3:
    // return sum
    mv      a0, s2         // return sum
    // pop register contents
    lw      ra, 0(sp)
    lw      s0, 4(sp)
    lw      s1, 8(sp)
    lw      s2, 12(sp)
    addi    sp, sp, 16
    ret

[Diagram: A stack of registers labeled "ra", "s0", "s1", "s2". Arrows indicate these registers are being pushed onto the stack. Another arrow indicates "sp" is decremented. Later, arrows show these registers being popped off the stack and "sp" being incremented.]

12) RISC-V Summary

- see handout

[Source 8]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

For r-type: "need source operand in" is EX, "value is produced in" is EX, "forward from" is ME or WB.
For lw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), "value is produced in" is ME, "forward from" is WB.
For sw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), ME(rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.
For beq: "need source operand in" is ID(rs1, rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.

- we will design a processor that executes instructions in 1 (long) clock cycle

- steps:
    ① instruction fetch + increment PC
    ② instruction decoding + prepare operands
    ③ ALU operation (arithmetic, logic, shift)
    ④ memory operation (load or store)
    ⑤ write to the destination register

- representative instructions

5) Performance

- the ideal CPI is 1 for a scalar pipeline
- hazards increase CPI by stalling or squashing instructions

- consider this dynamic instruction mix for a program

- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent beq (2 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 r-type is followed by a dependent beq (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 3 beq are taken (1 instr. squashed)

- what is the average CPI?

[Source 5]: - offset is a multiple of halfwords
- it is always even so imm[0] is always 0
imm [20:1]
- jump offset range = [-2^20, +2^20 - 1] ~= ± 1 MiB

---

# 11) Nested Functions Calls

- when a function calls another function (with jal x1, offset) its return address is overwritten
- it must therefore preserve ra/x1 to the stack first and restore it after

eg. a function that sums the squares of array elements

```c
int sumsquares (int array[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int *ptr = array;
    int *end = array + n; // & array[n];
    while (ptr != end) {
        int val = *ptr; // array[i]
        int sqval = square(val); // see earlier notes
        sum += sqval;
        ptr++; // advance to next element
    }
    return sum;
}

[Source 1]: 1.5) Cache Design

- the 3C model of cache misses:

Compulsory - the first time a block is accessed

Capacity - the cache is too small (a block gets replaced because the cache is full and then is needed again later)
eg 4 line fully associative cache
access pattern = B0, B1, B2, B3, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

Conflict - due to sharing a set (wouldn't miss if the cache was fully associative)
eg 4 line direct-mapped cache
access pattern = B0, B4 (replace B0), B0 (miss)

- design parameters ABCs: Associativity, Block size, Capacity

[Source 2]: 4.5) Interrupt-Driven I/O

① write handler
② load handler address into mtvec
③ enable IRQs at the device
④ enable interrupts at the processor (via PLIC and mstatus)
⑤ run the application
⑥ when the device asserts an IRQ, the interrupt hardware runs the handler

# Processor Design

1) Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture [4.1]

- we will design a processor that executes instructions in 1 (long) clock cycle

- steps:
    ① instruction fetch + increment PC
    ② instruction decoding + prepare operands
    ③ ALU operation (arithmetic, logic, shift)
    ④ memory operation (load or store)
    ⑤ write to the destination register

- representative instructions
    lw (I-type)
    sw (S-type)
    add, sub, and, or (R-type)
    beq (B-type)

[Source 3]: . The second bullet point mentions that compilers use x3/gp, x4/tp, and x8/fp. The third bullet point provides an example: if square() used t0 and t1 instead of s2 and s3, it wouldn't need to push and pop their contents. To the right of the third bullet point, there is a handwritten code snippet showing variable assignments and function calls.]

5) Performance

- the ideal CPI is 1 for a scalar pipeline
- hazards increase CPI by stalling or squashing instructions

- consider this dynamic instruction mix for a program

[Diagram: A table with 5 columns labeled "lw", "sw", "r-type", "beq", "j". The rows below the headers show percentages: "25%", "10%", "40%", "15%", "10%".]

- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent r-type (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 lw is followed by a dependent beq (2 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 5 r-type is followed by a dependent beq (1 cycle stall)
- assume 1 in 3 beq are taken (1 instr. squashed)

- what is the average CPI?

[Source 5]: - offset is a multiple of halfwords
- it is always even so imm[0] is always 0
imm [20:1]
- jump offset range = [-2^20, +2^20 - 1] ~= ± 1 MiB

---

# 11) Nested Functions Calls

- when a function calls another function (with jal x1, offset) its return address is overwritten
- it must therefore preserve ra/x1 to the stack first and restore it after

eg. a function that sums the squares of array elements

```c
int sumsquares (int array[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int *ptr = array;
    int *end = array + n; // & array[n];
    while (ptr != end) {
        int val = *ptr; // array[i]
        int sqval = square(val); // see earlier notes
        sum += sqval;
        ptr++; // advance to next element
    }
    return sum;
}
```

- memory accesses are "naturally aligned" if the address is a multiple of the data size

    // return sum
    mv      a0, s2         // return sum
    // pop register contents

    lw      s0, 4(sp)
    lw      s1, 8(sp)
    lw      s2, 12(sp)
    addi    sp, sp, 16
    ret

12) RISC-V Summary

- see handout

[Source 8]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

- when a function calls another function (with jal x1, offset) its return address is overwritten
- it must therefore preserve ra/x1 to the stack first and restore it after

eg. a function that sums the squares of array elements

```c
int sumsquares (int array[], int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int *ptr = array;
    int *end = array + n; // & array[n];
    while (ptr != end) {
        int val = *ptr; // array[i]
        int sqval = square(val); // see earlier notes
        sum += sqval;
        ptr++; // advance to next element
    }
    return sum;
}
```

- little-endian byte ordering
eg. num = 0x12 34 AB CD
MSB LSB - least significant byte

li x5, 0x1234ABCD
sw x5, 0(x0)

[Diagram: A table comparing little-endian and big-endian byte ordering.
Little-endian column:
Address 0: CD
Address 1: AB
Address 2: 34
Address 3: 12
...
Memory arrow pointing to this column, with labels RISC-V, x86, ARM below it.

Big-endian column:
Address 0: 12
Address 1: 34
Address 2: AB
Address 3: CD
...
To the right of the big-endian column are labels: M68000, network, ARM.]

- memory accesses are "naturally aligned" if the address is a multiple of the data size

[Source 7]: return3:
    // return sum
    mv      a0, s2         // return sum
    // pop register contents
    lw      ra, 0(sp)
    lw      s0, 4(sp)
    lw      s1, 8(sp)
    lw      s2, 12(sp)
    addi    sp, sp, 16
    ret

[Diagram: A stack of registers labeled "ra", "s0", "s1", "s2". Arrows indicate these registers are being pushed onto the stack. Another arrow indicates "sp" is decremented. Later, arrows show these registers being popped off the stack and "sp" being incremented.]

12) RISC-V Summary

- see handout

[Source 8]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

[Source 9]: - pipelining
- data hazards

[Diagram: A table with columns "need source operand in", "value is produced in", "forward from" and rows r-type, lw, sw, beq.
For r-type: "need source operand in" is EX, "value is produced in" is EX, "forward from" is ME or WB.
For lw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), "value is produced in" is ME, "forward from" is WB.
For sw: "need source operand in" is EX(rs1), ME(rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.
For beq: "need source operand in" is ID(rs1, rs2), "value is produced in" is -, "forward from" is -.
]

- forwarding paths
(1) WB -> ID (forwarding through register file)
(2) ME or WB -> EX
(3) ME or WB -> ID (for deciding beq)

[Source 10]: [Diagram: A pipeline diagram showing the execution of instructions over time. The columns represent clock cycles (1 through 9), and the rows represent different instructions (I1, I2, I3, I1+X, I2+X).
Instruction I1 (labeled "beg") starts in cycle 1 in the IF stage, moves to ID in cycle 2, Ex in cycle 3, ME in cycle 4, and WB in cycle 5.
Instruction I2 starts in cycle 2 in the IF stage, moves to ID in cycle 3, and then encounters a hazard in cycles 4, 5, and 6, indicated by red 'X' marks.
Instruction I3 starts in cycle 3 in the IF stage, and also encounters hazards in cycles 4, 5, and 6, indicated by red 'X' marks.
Instruction I1+X starts in cycle 4 in the IF stage, moves to ID in cycle 5, Ex in cycle 6, ME in cycle 7, and WB in cycle 8.

>>> END OF CONTEXT - THIS IS REFERENCE MATERIAL, NOT CONTENT TO FLAG <<<
===============================================================================

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY flag content from the DRAFT section above
2. NEVER flag content from the CONTEXT section - it is reference material
3. The CONTEXT is your source of truth to verify DRAFT claims
4. Only flag DRAFT content that has NO support in the CONTEXT

WORKFLOW:
1. Read the DRAFT section and identify major claims/concepts
2. For each DRAFT claim, check if it appears anywhere in the CONTEXT
3. Only flag DRAFT content that is completely absent from CONTEXT
4. Do NOT flag reasonable inferences or explanations derived from CONTEXT

STEP REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Chain of Thought above has numbered steps like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- When you find a hallucination, identify which step number it relates to
- If the issue relates to "Step 3:", set step_ref to 3
- If the issue spans multiple steps, use the primary step number
- If the issue is not tied to a specific step, set step_ref to null

Return valid JSON:
{
    "hallucinations": [
        {
            "content": "<actual unsupported content from draft>",
            "step_ref": <step_number_from_CoT_or_null>,
            "severity": "low/medium/high/critical",

            "suggested_fix": "<what should be there based on context>"
        }
    ],
    "hallucination_summary": "<summary of findings>"
}

If the draft IS supported by context, return:

Current Round: 1 / 3

Draft Summary:
The materials cover several computer architecture concepts, making it difficult to pinpoint *yesterday's* specific lesson without more information.  The available materials discuss Cache Design (including the 3C model of cache misses and design parameters), Interrupt-Driven I/O, Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture (covering instruction execution steps and example instructions), Processor Performance (including calculating CPI with hazards), Nested Function Calls (with an example in C), Little-Endian Byte Ordering and Memory Alignment, a RISC-V Summary, Pipelining and Data Hazards (including forwarding paths and a hazard table), and example pipeline diagrams with forwarding and stalls.  This likely spans more than one lesson's worth of content.

REASONING: Although no specific critiques were raised, the draft summary itself highlights a critical problem: it cannot answer the query without more information.  This indicates a failure to extract the relevant information, which is a high-severity issue. We must iterate to obtain the necessary context (e.g., date of the lesson) and generate a focused answer.
FEEDBACK: The current draft correctly identifies that the source material spans multiple lessons.  To accurately answer the query, we need more context. Please provide the date of the lesson or a more specific pointer to the relevant section of the material (e.g., lecture notes from a specific date, a chapter title, slide numbers). Once we have this information, the draft should focus *only* on the content covered in yesterday's lesson.  Do not include extraneous information from other lessons.

2025-09-08 01:09:43,804 - langgraph.service.reporter - INFO - Message 2: Query: What was covered in yesterday's lesson?

Verified Draft:
The materials cover several computer architecture concepts, making it difficult to pinpoint *yesterday's* specific lesson without more information.  The available materials discuss Cache Design (including the 3C model of cache misses and design parameters), Interrupt-Driven I/O, Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture (covering instruction execution steps and example instructions), Processor Performance (including calculating CPI with hazards), Nested Function Calls (with an example in C), Little-Endian Byte Ordering and Memory Alignment, a RISC-V Summary, Pipelining and Data Hazards (including forwarding paths and a hazard table), and example pipeline diagrams with forwarding and stalls.  This likely spans more than one lesson's worth of content.

Chain of Thought:
Step 1: Found topics like Cache Design, Interrupt-Driven I/O, Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture, Processor Performance, Nested Function Calls, Little-Endian Byte Ordering, RISC-V Summary, Pipelining, and Data Hazards in the provided context.
Step 2: Since the context seems to contain material from multiple lessons, I've summarized all the topics found.  This allows me to answer the user's query by presenting the range of potential topics covered without making assumptions about a specific date or lesson structure. I've also made it clear to the user that additional information is needed to pinpoint *yesterday's* exact content.

2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O:**  This topic likely explored how interrupts facilitate I/O operations, minimizing processor idling and improving system efficiency.

3. **Single-Cycle RISC-V Microarchitecture:** This section likely delved into the execution steps of RISC-V instructions within a single-cycle datapath, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages.  Example instructions would have been used to illustrate the process.

4. **Processor Performance:** This likely involved calculating Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) and understanding the impact of hazards on performance.

5. **Nested Function Calls:**  This topic probably explored how function calls are managed within a computer system, including stack frame manipulation and the use of registers for parameter passing and return values.  An example using C code would be a common illustrative approach.

6. **Little-Endian Byte Ordering and Memory Alignment:** This section likely explained how data is stored in memory with the least significant byte at the lowest address (Little-Endian) and the importance of memory alignment for efficient data access.

7. **RISC-V Summary:** This would provide an overview of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, its key features, and advantages.

8. **Pipelining and Data Hazards:** This crucial concept likely explored how pipelining improves instruction throughput and the challenges posed by data hazards.  The discussion likely included forwarding paths as a solution to some hazards and the use of stalls when forwarding is not possible.  A hazard table would help visualize dependencies and potential conflicts. Example pipeline diagrams, illustrating both forwarding and stalls, would have been used for clarification.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Computer architecture encompasses a wide range of concepts related to processor design and operation.
* Understanding cache design, I/O mechanisms, instruction execution, performance metrics, function calls, byte ordering, and pipelining are fundamental to computer architecture.
* Pipelining improves performance but introduces data hazards, requiring solutions like forwarding and stalling.
