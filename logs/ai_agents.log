[32;1m[1;3mSystem: You are an expert at reformulating educational queries for better retrieval from course materials.
When initial retrieval quality is poor, generate alternative queries that might yield better results.
Keep the queries closely related to the original intent and topic.
Human: Original Query: What’s the middle name of the current CEO of OpenAI?

Initial Results Quality Score: 0.33292616771047223
Quality Issues: Low similarity scores

The original query didn't match well with the course materials. Generate 3 alternative query formulations that:
1. Use different terminology or perspectives while staying on the same topic
2. Are more specific or break down the concept
3. Focus on different aspects of the SAME topic as the original query

IMPORTANT: 
- Keep all alternative queries closely related to the original query's topic
- Generate CONCRETE queries without placeholders or brackets
- If the query mentions "yesterday" or "recent", rephrase to be about "recent topics" or "latest materials"

Format each query on a new line starting with "QUERY:".

Example for "What was covered in yesterday's lesson?":
QUERY: recent topics covered in class
QUERY: latest lecture materials and concepts
QUERY: most recent course content and examples[0m

- Text was traditionally represented with ASCII
  - see handout
  - lower- and upper-case letters differ by 1 bit

eg. A = 100 0001 a = 110 0001

eg. to ensure an alphabetic character in x5 is upper case

- The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

. The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset. The ID stage also includes an Instruction Memory outputting Data. The EX stage involves an ALU which takes inputs from the Registers (Read data 1) and an offset. The ALU outputs an ALU result and a Zero flag. The EX stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the ALU result and the branch target address. The ME stage involves a Data Memory which takes an Address input and a Write data input. The Data Memory outputs Read data. The ME stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the Read data from the Data Memory and the ALU result, labeled as MemtoReg. The WB stage is the final stage.]

The "privilege level" column lists "highest" next to "machine (m)", with a downward arrow pointing to "lowest" next to "user (u)". "hypervisor (h)" and "supervisor (s)" are positioned between "machine (m)" and "user (u)". A note in red ink to the right of the table reads "(code in the lab runs in machine mode)".]

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

# 13) Text [2.9]

- Text was traditionally represented with ASCII
  - see handout
  - lower- and upper-case letters differ by 1 bit

eg. A = 100 0001 a = 110 0001

eg. to ensure an alphabetic character in x5 is upper case

[Source 2]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

[Source 3]: . The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset.

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

===============================================================================
>>> SOLUTION DRAFT TO ANALYZE (ONLY THIS CONTENT CAN BE CRITICIZED) <<<
===============================================================================
Yesterday's lesson covered several key aspects of computer architecture, with a particular focus on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).  We learned about RISC-V register conventions, different instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, J-type), and how to translate simple C code to RISC-V assembly.  The concept of traps and handlers for managing control flow was also introduced.  In addition, we explored memory hierarchy concepts, including multi-level caches (L1, L2, L3) and their organization.  Finally, the lesson touched upon ASCII and Unicode character encoding.
===============================================================================
>>> END OF DRAFT <<<
===============================================================================

>>> CHAIN OF THOUGHT TO ANALYZE <<<
===============================================================================
Step 1: The retrieved context includes topics such as: RISC-V Register Conventions, ASCII and Unicode Text Representation, Multi-Level Caches, Cache Performance, Control Flow and Handlers, RISC-V Modes and Privilege Levels, RISC-V Instruction Set, Data Forwarding and Hazard Detection, and C to Assembly Language Translation.
Step 2: The query asks about the middle name of the CEO of OpenAI.  Unfortunately, *none* of the provided context materials contains any information about OpenAI or its CEO. The context exclusively covers computer architecture concepts related to RISC-V processors, assembly language, and memory organization.  Therefore, it's impossible to answer the query using the provided lesson materials.
===============================================================================
>>> END OF CHAIN OF THOUGHT <<<
===============================================================================

CRITICAL: Analyze ONLY the draft and chain of thought above. Look for REAL logical issues such as:
- Contradictory statements within the draft
- Logical leaps in the reasoning chain
- Assumptions that aren't supported by prior steps
- Conclusions that don't follow from premises

STEP REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Chain of Thought above has numbered steps like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- When you find a logical issue, identify which step number it relates to
- If the issue relates to "Step 3:", set step_ref to 3
- If the issue spans multiple steps, use the primary step number
- If the issue is not tied to a specific step, set step_ref to null

Do NOT make up fake issues. Analyze only what is actually written in the draft above.

Return valid JSON:

Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

>>> END OF CONTEXT - THIS IS REFERENCE MATERIAL, NOT CONTENT TO CRITICIZE <<<
===============================================================================

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY analyze claims made in the DRAFT section above
2. NEVER criticize or fact-check content from the CONTEXT section
3. The CONTEXT is your reference material to verify DRAFT claims
4. If you see content in CONTEXT, it is CORRECT - do not question it
5. Only report issues where the DRAFT contradicts or lacks support from CONTEXT

WORKFLOW:
1. Read the DRAFT section and identify factual claims
2. For each DRAFT claim, check if it's supported by the CONTEXT
3. Only flag DRAFT claims that contradict or lack support in CONTEXT

STEP REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Chain of Thought above has numbered steps like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- When you find a factual issue, identify which step number it relates to
- If the issue relates to "Step 3:", set step_ref to 3
- If the issue spans multiple steps, use the primary step number
- If the issue is not tied to a specific step, set step_ref to null

Return valid JSON:

Current Round: 1 / 3

Draft Summary:
Yesterday's lesson covered several key aspects of computer architecture, with a particular focus on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).  We learned about RISC-V register conventions, different instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, J-type), and how to translate simple C code to RISC-V assembly.  The concept of traps and handlers for managing control flow was also introduced.  In addition, we explored memory hierarchy concepts, including multi-level caches (L1, L2, L3) and their organization.  Finally, the lesson touched upon ASCII and Unicode character encoding.

REASONING: A critical issue was found (hallucination).  The draft summary is completely unrelated to the query about the OpenAI CEO's middle name. Quality standards require addressing all critical issues before converging.
FEEDBACK: The current draft is a hallucination and completely off-topic.  Discard the current content entirely. The query asks for the middle name of the current CEO of OpenAI.  The response should focus on finding and providing this information. If the information is not available, state that clearly. Do not fabricate information or summarize unrelated topics.

The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.

. The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset. The ID stage also includes an Instruction Memory outputting Data. The EX stage involves an ALU which takes inputs from the Registers (Read data 1) and an offset. The ALU outputs an ALU result and a Zero flag. The EX stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the ALU result and the branch target address. The ME stage involves a Data Memory which takes an Address input and a Write data input. The Data Memory outputs Read data. The ME stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the Read data from the Data Memory and the ALU result, labeled as MemtoReg.

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

We learned about RISC-V register conventions, different instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, J-type), and how to translate simple C code to RISC-V assembly.  The concept of traps and handlers for managing control flow was also introduced.  In addition, we explored memory hierarchy concepts, including multi-level caches (L1, L2, L3) and their organization.  Finally, the lesson touched upon ASCII and Unicode character encoding.

# 13) Text [2.9]

- Text was traditionally represented with ASCII
  - see handout
  - lower- and upper-case letters differ by 1 bit

eg. A = 100 0001 a = 110 0001

eg. to ensure an alphabetic character in x5 is upper case

[Source 2]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.
- The diagram also shows a pipeline timing chart with stages IF, ID, EX, ME, WB, and a timeline from 1 to 7.
- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

[Source 3]: . The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset. The ID stage also includes an Instruction Memory outputting Data. The EX stage involves an ALU which takes inputs from the Registers (Read data 1) and an offset. The ALU outputs an ALU result and a Zero flag. The EX stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the ALU result and the branch target address. The ME stage involves a Data Memory which takes an Address input and a Write data input. The Data Memory outputs Read data. The ME stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the Read data from the Data Memory and the ALU result, labeled as MemtoReg. The WB stage is the final stage.]

An arrow labeled "handler returns" originates from the "handler" and points back towards the "running code", indicating the resumption of execution.]

- the running code is unaware that it has been suspended and resumed

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

===============================================================================
Step 1: The feedback explicitly states the previous draft was a hallucination and completely off-topic.  The provided context discusses computer architecture concepts related to RISC-V. None of this information pertains to OpenAI or its CEO. Therefore, I must acknowledge that the requested information cannot be found within the given context.
===============================================================================
>>> END OF CHAIN OF THOUGHT <<<
===============================================================================

CRITICAL: Analyze ONLY the draft and chain of thought above. Look for REAL logical issues such as:
- Contradictory statements within the draft
- Logical leaps in the reasoning chain
- Assumptions that aren't supported by prior steps
- Conclusions that don't follow from premises

STEP REFERENCE INSTRUCTIONS:
- The Chain of Thought above has numbered steps like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- When you find a logical issue, identify which step number it relates to
- If the issue relates to "Step 3:", set step_ref to 3
- If the issue spans multiple steps, use the primary step number
- If the issue is not tied to a specific step, set step_ref to null

Do NOT make up fake issues. Analyze only what is actually written in the draft above.

Return valid JSON:

[Source 3]: . The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset. The ID stage also includes an Instruction Memory outputting Data. The EX stage involves an ALU which takes inputs from the Registers (Read data 1) and an offset. The ALU outputs an ALU result and a Zero flag. The EX stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the ALU result and the branch target address. The ME stage involves a Data Memory which takes an Address input and a Write data input. The Data Memory outputs Read data. The ME stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the Read data from the Data Memory and the ALU result, labeled as MemtoReg. The WB stage is the final stage.]

[Source 2]: - The "alu. result" from "ME/WB" is also fed back to the multiplexers controlling "ForwardA" and "ForwardB" via red lines.
- The multiplexers have control inputs labeled "0", "1", "2". The "2" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "EX/ME" stage. The "1" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "alu. result" from the "ME/WB" stage. The "0" input for both multiplexers is connected to the "rd data1" and "rd data2" from the "ID/EX" stage respectively.

- Three example instructions are shown: "add x7, x5, x6", "add x8, x7, 1", "add x10, x9, x7".

[Source 3]: . The Registers have inputs for Register # and output Read data 1 and Read data 2. The Instruction also provides an offset. The ID stage also includes an Instruction Memory outputting Data. The EX stage involves an ALU which takes inputs from the Registers (Read data 1) and an offset. The ALU outputs an ALU result and a Zero flag. The EX stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the ALU result and the branch target address. The ME stage involves a Data Memory which takes an Address input and a Write data input. The Data Memory outputs Read data. The ME stage also has a multiplexer that selects between the Read data from the Data Memory and the ALU result, labeled as MemtoReg. The WB stage is the final stage.]

1.4) Multi-Level Caches

[Diagram: A hierarchical diagram illustrating multi-level caches. At the top are two "processors" labeled "core 0" and "core 1". Each core has two associated cache levels: L1-I (instruction cache) and L1-D (data cache). Below the L1 caches, there is an L2 cache for each core, described as "unified (both instr. + data)". The L2 caches are connected to a shared L3 cache, which is described as "shared between cores". A dashed line separates the L3 cache from "main memory (DRAM)", with annotations indicating "on chip" above the line and "off chip" below the line. The L1 caches are annotated with sizes: "32-64 KiB each" for L1-I and L1-D, and "1-2 MiB" for L2. The L3 cache is annotated with "2-8 MiB/core".]

2025-09-08 01:00:28,379 - langgraph.service.reporter - INFO - Message 2: Query: What’s the middle name of the current CEO of OpenAI?

Verified Draft:
I am unable to find the middle name of the current CEO of OpenAI within the provided context. The text focuses on computer architecture, specifically the RISC-V instruction set, and does not contain information about OpenAI or its CEO.

Chain of Thought:
Step 1: The feedback explicitly states the previous draft was a hallucination and completely off-topic.  The provided context discusses computer architecture concepts related to RISC-V. None of this information pertains to OpenAI or its CEO. Therefore, I must acknowledge that the requested information cannot be found within the given context.

Remaining Minor Issues (if any):
None

Debate Status: converged
Quality Score: 1.0

Create a polished final answer with:
1. INTRODUCTION: Brief problem overview
2. STEP_BY_STEP_SOLUTION: Clear, detailed solution
3. KEY_TAKEAWAYS: Important concepts to remember
4. SOURCES: Relevant source citations
