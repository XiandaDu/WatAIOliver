- **C.** Let *x* represent the number of \$5 bills, and let *y* represent the number of \$10 bills. Write an equation for combinations of these bills with a total value of \$100.
- **D.** Graph your equation for part C. Should you use a solid or broken line? Explain.
- **E.** Describe how the number of \$10 bills changes as the number of \$5 bills increases.
- **F.** Explain what the *x*-intercept and *y*-intercept represent on your graph.
- **G.** Which points on your graph are not possible combinations? Explain why.
- **H.** Determine all the possible combinations of \$5 bills and \$10 bills that equal \$100.
