# Design Decisions

## Student Class:
I have a default constructor, and a constructor that takes a name and student number and sets name and value respectively. The destructor is empty.

## doubleHash Class:
I have a constructor that takes in an integer x. It then creates a new dynamically allocated array of student objects and sets max size of the array to x. The destructor deletes the array of student objects.
