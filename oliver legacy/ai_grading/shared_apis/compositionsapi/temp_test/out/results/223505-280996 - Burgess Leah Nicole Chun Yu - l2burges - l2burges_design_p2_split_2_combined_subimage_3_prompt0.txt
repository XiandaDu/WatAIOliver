# chainingHash Class:
I have a constructor that takes in an integer x. It then creates a new dynamically allocated array of vectors that hold student objects and sets max size of the array to x. The destructor deletes the array of vectors holding the student objects.

* I did not override any operators and I did not have to pass each parameter by reference or use of the keyword "const".
