# Design Decisions:

## Url Class:
- I have default constructor, and a constructor that takes in a name and value and sets name and value respectively and next and prev pointers to nullptr.
- I have a destructor that deletes the next pointer and sets the address to nullptr.

## Linked List Class:
- I have a constructor that sets head and tail to nullptr.
- I have a destructor that deletes the head pointer and sets its address to nullptr.
