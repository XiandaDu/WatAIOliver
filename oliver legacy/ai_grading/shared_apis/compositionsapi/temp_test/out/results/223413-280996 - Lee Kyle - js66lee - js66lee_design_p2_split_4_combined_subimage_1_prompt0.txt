# 5. Performance

Commands with a time complexity of O(1) are insert, search, and delete. A command "insert" inserts a new key into the hash table using the hash function. For both open addressing and separate chaining, assuming uniform hashing, finding the appropriate position to insert can be done in O(1), and inserting key/value also has a time complexity of O(1). Hence the resulting time complexity is O(1). A command "search" searches a key from the hash table by utilizing the hash function. Assuming uniform hashing, a searching operation can be done in O(1) for both open addressing and separate chaining. Finally, the command "delete" deletes a key from the hash table if it exists. Since it behaves like a "search" except for deleting the found key from the table, considering that deleting the key is executed with the time complexity of O(1), deleting operation can also achieve a time complexity of O(1).
