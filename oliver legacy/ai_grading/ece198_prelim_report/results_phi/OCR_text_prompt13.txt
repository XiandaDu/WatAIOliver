 <answer>yes</answer>\n\nThe report provided meets the criterion that every functional requirement must have an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically, and the report includes a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. Here is the evidence from the report:\n\n1. Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius.\n2. Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute.\n3. Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11.\n4. Displays light warnings between 150 and 200 millicandelas (luminous intensity of hobby LEDs) and sound warnings of at least 70 decibels (like an alarm clock).\n\nEach of these functional requirements has a clear, quantifiable measurement with a specified range of values and relevant units.\n\n\n"}
