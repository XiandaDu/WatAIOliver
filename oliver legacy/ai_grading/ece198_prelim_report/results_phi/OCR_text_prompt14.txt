 <answer>yes</answer> The report provided by Nathan Jiang and Oluwatise Okusanaya for the \"Heat Stress Detector\" project includes functional requirements with associated measurements that are quantifiable numerically and include a range of values with relevant units. For instance, the device is designed to measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute, and ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11. These requirements are clearly stated with specific numerical ranges and units, indicating that the project meets the criteria for functional requirements with quantifiable measurements.\n\nGiven that the project is being undertaken by first-semester engineering students, it is feasible for them to perform these measurements for every functional requirement. The report demonstrates that the students have a clear understanding of the functional requirements and have incorporated them into the design of the device. The use of mathematical principles, such as standard deviation and systems of linear equations, further supports the feasibility of the project for first-semester engineering students.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided report, it is feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform measurements for every functional requirement in the \"Heat Stress Detector\" project. The report includes clear, quantifiable measurements with specified ranges and units, and the students have demonstrated an understanding of the necessary mathematical principles to implement these requirements.\n"}
