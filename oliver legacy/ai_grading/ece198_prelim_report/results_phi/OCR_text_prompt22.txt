 <answer>yes</answer>\n\nThe report includes clear safety requirements and they appear to be adequate for the problem. The safety requirements section states:\n\n- No more than 30W of power (in any form) may be consumed, transferred, discharged or expended at any point in time\n- The project must not store more than 500mJ of energy (in any form) at any point in time\n- Electrical insulation will be applied\n\nThese requirements address potential electrical hazards and ensure that the device operates within safe limits. Additionally, the device's design includes warnings for high body temperature, over-exertion, and high UV exposure, which are all relevant to the problem of heat stress for farm workers.\n\nThe report also includes references to standards and regulations, such as the Medical Devices Regulations (Government of Canada, [9]) and the Electrical Safety Regulations (Government of Canada, [9]). These references demonstrate that the project is considering relevant safety standards and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, the report includes clear safety requirements and they appear to be adequate for the problem of heat stress for farm workers.\n\n\n"}
