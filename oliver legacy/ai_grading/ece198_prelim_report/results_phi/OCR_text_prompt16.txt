 <answer>No</answer>\n<evidence>The report does not provide a direct citation for each functional requirement listed. While there are citations present in the document, they are not explicitly linked to each functional requirement to support why it should be included. For example, the requirement to measure body temperature in a specific range is mentioned, but there is no direct citation provided that supports this specific requirement. Similarly, the requirement to measure heart rate and UV exposure also lacks direct citations. Therefore, based on the given standards, it cannot be confirmed that every requirement is clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included.</evidence>\n"}
