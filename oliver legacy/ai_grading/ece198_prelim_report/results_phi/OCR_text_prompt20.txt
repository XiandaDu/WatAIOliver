 <answer>yes</answer>\n<evidence>The report clearly states that the technical requirements are focused on the creation of a device that measures body temperature, heart rate, and UV exposure to warn users of potential heat stress. Each requirement is directly related to the problem of heat stress for farm workers, as outlined in the introduction and customer problem sections. The requirements are:\n\n1. Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of high body temperature [10]\n2. Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warns user of over-exertion [11]\n3. Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11, the full range of the scale, providing warnings for potential sunburn [12]\n\nThese requirements are appropriate for the problem defined in the report, as they directly address the symptoms and causes of heat stress mentioned in the introduction and customer problem sections. The report also includes a list of stakeholders and their needs and concerns, which further supports the appropriateness of the technical requirements.</evidence>\n<additional_information>The report also includes a list of stakeholders and their needs and concerns, which further supports the appropriateness of the technical requirements. The stakeholders include farm workers, employers, governmental or regulatory bodies, and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. The needs and concerns of each stakeholder are addressed in the functional requirements section of the report. For example, the project warns the user before the onset of heat stroke, protecting their health, and accurately measures heartbeat, body temperature, and UV exposure without giving false warnings, which would impact productivity. The project also improves productivity by keeping workers from suffering from heat stroke and reduces the responsibility of the worker's health for employers. The project is well insulated to prevent the customer from getting shocked, and its characteristics and performance do not deteriorate under normal use to a degree where the customer is adversely affected. The project records accurate readings of heartbeat, body temperature, and UV exposure to provide leverage against employers looking to confront their employers regarding unsafe working conditions.</additional"}
