 <answer>Yes</answer>\n\nEvidence from the report:\n\n\"The final mathematical principle this project would make use of is inequality. Inequality functions can be given such as:\n\n\\[\nx < 5, x > 5 [20]\n\\]\n\nWe would assign a variable to the standard/expected ranges of our quantities (temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index) which could come in the forms of x, y, z. When the detected quantity is above the set range, warnings are given.\"\n\nThis statement clearly describes how the customer's life would be improved if the problem of heat stress were solved. By using inequality functions to monitor temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index, the device can provide warnings when these values exceed safe ranges, helping to prevent heat-related illnesses and improve the lives of farm workers.\n\nAdditionally, the report mentions that the device will \"improve the lives of farm workers by helping them avoid the causes of heat-related illnesses. They will be able to work knowing that they are in safe conditions.\" This statement also demonstrates how the customer's life would be improved if the problem were solved.\n\nLastly, the report states that the device will \"provide leverage or evidence for farm workers looking to confront their employers regarding unsafe working conditions.\" This statement shows that the device will not only improve the lives of farm workers by preventing heat-related illnesses but also empower them to address unsafe working conditions.\n\nIn summary, the report provides evidence that the customer's life would be improved if the problem of heat stress were solved. The device will help prevent heat-related illnesses, provide evidence for farm workers to confront unsafe working conditions, and empower them to work in safe conditions.\n\n\n"}
