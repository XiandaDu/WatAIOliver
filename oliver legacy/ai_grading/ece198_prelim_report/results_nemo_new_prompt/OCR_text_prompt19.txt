The report does not provide quantifiable numerical measurements for every technical requirement. For instance, it mentions that the device should warn the user of over-exertion, but it does not specify the exact heart rate threshold that would trigger the warning. It only mentions that the warning should be based on a deviation of more than 23 beats per minute from the mean of the previous 15 minutes, but it does not provide a specific range for the mean heart rate. Similarly, it does not provide a specific range for the ultraviolet index that would trigger the warning, only mentioning that a warning should be issued when the index is 8 and above. Therefore, it is not feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements for every technical requirement as specified in the document.
