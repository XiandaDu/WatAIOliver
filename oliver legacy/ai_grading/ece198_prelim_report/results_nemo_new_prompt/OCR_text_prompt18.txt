The report does not provide a quantifiable numerical range with relevant units for the warning thresholds of the device. For example, it mentions that the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning when the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, but it does not specify the acceptable range for this warning threshold. Similarly, it does not provide a range for the heart rate deviation warning threshold or the ultraviolet index warning threshold. Therefore, not every technical requirement in the document meets the criterion of having an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically with a range of values and relevant units.
