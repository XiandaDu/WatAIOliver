The report does not explicitly describe all stakeholders and their interests in the project. While it mentions several stakeholders such as farm workers, employers, and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, it does not provide details about why these stakeholders are interested in the outcomes of this project. For example, it does not explain why the government or regulatory bodies are interested in the project's safety features, or why the Ontario Federation of Agriculture is interested in the project's recording capabilities.
