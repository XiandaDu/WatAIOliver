The report does not provide a quantifiable numerical range with relevant units for every functional requirement. For example, while the report mentions that the device should warn the user of over-exertion based on heart rate, it does not specify the exact range of heart rates that would trigger the warning, nor does it provide the relevant units (beats per minute). Similarly, while it mentions that the device should warn the user of high body temperature, it does not specify the exact range of temperatures that would trigger the warning, nor does it provide the relevant units (degrees Celsius). Therefore, not every functional requirement in the document meets the criterion of having an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically with a range of values and relevant units.
