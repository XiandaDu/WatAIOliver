The report clearly states that the device should measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature. This requirement is directly related to the problem defined in the report, which is to mitigate the danger of heat stress for farm workers. The specific temperature threshold for warning (37.2Â°C) is also provided, making the requirement clear and appropriate for the problem.
