No.

The report lists several technical requirements, such as measuring body temperature, heart rate, and ultraviolet index. However, it does not provide specific numerical ranges with units for these measurements. For example:

- "Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of over-exertion" (Initial Requirements)
- "Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warns user of over-exertion" (Initial Requirements)
- "Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 11 to 11, the full range of the scale, providing warnings for potential sunburn between 8 and 10, and 200 to 300 millidoullos intensity of hobby light" (Initial Requirements)

These requirements lack the necessary numerical ranges and units to be considered quantifiable. As a result, it would be challenging for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements accurately.
