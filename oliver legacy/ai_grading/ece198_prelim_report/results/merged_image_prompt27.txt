Yes, the report includes three scientific principles, mathematical principles, and engineering standards, and each is clearly and explicitly stated. Here is the direct evidence from the report:

1. **Scientific Principles:**
   - **Principle 1:** The report mentions the principle of heat stress and its effects on farm workers, including symptoms and causes.
   - **Principle 2:** The report discusses the principle of heat stroke and its symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing.
   - **Principle 3:** The report references the principle of heat exhaustion and its symptoms, including nausea and dizziness.

2. **Mathematical Principles:**
   - **Principle 1:** The report discusses the mathematical principle of standard deviation to measure the deviation in the user's heart rate.
   - **Principle 2:** The report mentions the use of inequality functions to determine if the detected quantity is above the set range, triggering a warning.
   - **Principle 3:** The report references the mathematical principle of linear equations to model body temperature trends and offer early warnings.

3. **Engineering Standards:**
   - **Standard 1:** The report mentions the safety requirement of not exceeding 30W of power consumption.
   - **Standard 2:** The report discusses the requirement of electrical insulation to prevent electrical hazards.
   - **Standard 3:** The report references the principle of using principles from the IEEE standard for microcontroller programming.

For each principle or standard mentioned, the report provides a reasonable explanation of how it contributes to solving the problem of heat stress detection for farm workers.
