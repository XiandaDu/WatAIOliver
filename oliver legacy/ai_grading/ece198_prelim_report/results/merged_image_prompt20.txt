Yes, every requirement listed in the document is clearly appropriate for the problem defined in the report.

Direct evidence from the report:
- The functional requirements include measuring body temperature, detecting UV light, and providing warnings for over-exposure to UV light and dangerous outdoor temperatures. These are all relevant to the problem of heat stress for farm workers.
- The technical requirements include using mathematical principles to calculate standard deviation and inequality functions, which are appropriate for analyzing and interpreting the data collected by the device to determine heat stress levels and provide warnings.
- The safety requirements, such as using 30W of power and applying electrical insulation, ensure the device is safe for use in potentially hazardous conditions.
- The principles section explains the use of mathematical principles to analyze the data and provide warnings, which is directly relevant to the problem of heat stress detection and prevention.
