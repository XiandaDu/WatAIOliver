The report does not clearly associate every functional requirement with a citation that supports why it should be included. For example, the requirement for the device to measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature is not supported by any citation. The report only mentions that the device should warn the user before the onset of heat stroke, but it does not provide any specific temperature range or source to support this requirement.
