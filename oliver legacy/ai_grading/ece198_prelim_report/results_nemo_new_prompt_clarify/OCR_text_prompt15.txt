The report clearly states that the functional requirements listed are appropriate for the problem defined in the report. The problem is about mitigating the danger of heat stress for farm workers in Ontario, and the functional requirements directly address this problem by measuring and warning the user about high body temperature, over-exertion, and dangerous UV exposure. Here are some direct quotes from the report that support this:

- "A device will be created that warns the user of over-exertion, over-exposure to UV light and dangerous outdoor temperatures."
- "Measures body temperature... and warns user of high body temperature"
- "Measures heart rate... and warns user of over-exertion"
- "Measures ultraviolet index... providing warnings for potential sunburn"
