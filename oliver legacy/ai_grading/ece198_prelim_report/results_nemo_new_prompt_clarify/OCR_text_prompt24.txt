<answer>No</answer>

The report does not provide a clear, accurate description of what the mathematical principle of standard deviation is and why it was included. While it mentions that standard deviation indicates how data is dispersed around the mean, it does not explain how this principle will be used in the project or why it is important for the project's success. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.
