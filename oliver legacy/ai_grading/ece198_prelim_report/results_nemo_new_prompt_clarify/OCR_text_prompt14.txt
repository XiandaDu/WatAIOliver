The report does not provide any evidence that the students have the necessary skills or equipment to perform the measurements for every functional requirement. While the report lists the required measurements, it does not mention how these measurements will be taken or what equipment will be used. Therefore, it is not feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements without further guidance or resources.
