The report does not provide a quantifiable numerical range with relevant units for the warning thresholds of the device. For example, it mentions that the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning when the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, but it does not provide a range of acceptable temperatures or the units for the warning thresholds. Therefore, not every technical requirement in the document meets the criterion of having an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically with relevant units.
