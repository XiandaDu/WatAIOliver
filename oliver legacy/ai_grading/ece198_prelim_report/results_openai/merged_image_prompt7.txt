### Consider only the technical requirements listed in the document. Is every requirement clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer.

**Answer: No**
- Direct evidence: In the section titled "Technical Requirements," various requirements are listed (e.g., the need for the device to "monitor temperature and humidity levels continuously"), but there are no clear citations directly associated with why these particular requirements should be included. The requirements are listed, but justifications from sources are not provided directly next to them.

### Safety is extremely important for any engineering work. Does the report include clear safety requirements, and are those requirements adequate for the problem? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer.

**Answer: Yes**
- Direct evidence: The report includes a specific section under "Safety Requirements" that details various safety considerations, such as "the device must not overheat," "must be made of non-toxic materials," and implementing an "automatic shut-off feature if a malfunction occurs." These safety requirements are clearly articulated and seem relevant and adequate for addressing the problem of creating a heat stress detector.

### The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totaling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated. Are there three such principles/standards clearly stated in the report? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer.

**Answer: Yes**
- Direct evidence: 
  1. **Scientific Principle**: The report refers to the "principle of heat transfer" in the "Technology Principles" section.
  2. **Mathematical Principle**: The "Mathematical Modeling" subsection discusses the "Stefan-Boltzmann Law" for radiative heat transfer.
  3. **Engineering Standard**: The report references "IEEE Std 802.15.4," which is an established standard for networking communications.

All three components are clearly and explicitly stated in the document.
