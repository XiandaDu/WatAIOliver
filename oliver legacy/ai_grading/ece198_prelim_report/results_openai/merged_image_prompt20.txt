**Answer:** Yes

**Direct Evidence:**
1. The report defines the problem as the need for early detection and prevention of heat stress, which "can lead to serious conditions including heat exhaustion and heat stroke" (Introduction section).
2. The technical requirements listed in the report include:
   - Sensor Data Collection: "collect accurate readings of environmental conditions" (Sensor Design section).
   - Real-time Monitoring: "updates are essential to provide current status and predict heat stress in real-time" (System Requirements section).
   - Alert Notifications: "must alert the user with a warning before critical conditions are reached" (Alert System section).
   - User Interface: "should display easy-to-understand data and alerts to the user" (User Interface section).

These requirements are clearly appropriate for addressing the problem of detecting and preventing heat stress. Each listed requirement directly targets an aspect of the challenge specified in the introduction: collecting accurate data, providing real-time updates, issuing warnings, and presenting the information clearly to the user, all of which are integral to effectively managing and mitigating heat stress.
