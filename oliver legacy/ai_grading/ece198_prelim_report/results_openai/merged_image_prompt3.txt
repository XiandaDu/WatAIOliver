   - Yes.

2. Are all stakeholders clearly described, along with why they are interested in the outcomes of this project?
   - Yes. The report states: "Stakeholders:
     a. Construction workers and supervisors: vulnerable to heat stress
     b. Contractors: concern for the health and safety of workers
     c. Occupational health and safety regulators: enforcing heat stress safety standards
     d. Equipment manufacturers: ensuring compatibility with safety protocols and regulations."

3. The assignment distinguishes between "technical requirements" and "functional requirements". Are both types of requirements present in the document?
   - Yes. The report includes evidence for both:
     - Functional Requirements:
       "Functional requirements include but are not limited to the ability to detect heat stress symptoms early, real-time monitoring and alerting systems, and compatibility with wearable technology."
     - Technical Requirements:
       "Technical requirements specify the system must integrate with existing safety equipment, utilize reliable sensors for temperature and humidity, and be durable enough to sustain construction site conditions."
