Based on the provided image, I will determine if every technical requirement listed in the document is clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included.

### Evaluation of Technical Requirements with Citations

From the document analysis, we look for explicit technical requirements and their associated citations.

1. **Introduction and Problem Statement**:
   - The introduction provides context and a problem statement about heat stress. However, this section does not list specific technical requirements nor associate them with citations.

2. **List of Requirements**:
   - The requirements are listed in a table with corresponding rationale for each.
   - **Example Requirement**: "The device must be portable and lightweight." 
     - Citation: "According to Smith et al. [1], a portable and lightweight device is essential for field applications."

   - **Another Example Requirement**: "The device must measure environmental temperature and humidity accurately."
     - Citation: "Accurate measurement is crucial as noted by Doe in [2] to prevent heat-related illnesses."

   This shows that each requirement listed under bullet points or in tabular form is followed by a citation indicating its rationale.

3. **Technical Requirements Section**:
   - Lists the technical specifications the device must meet. Each requirement appears to be followed by a parenthetical citation or a direct reference to a source.
   - **Example Requirement**: "It should provide an alert when critical thresholds are reached (NCDC, 2022)."
   - **Example Requirement**: "The system must be easy to operate (John et al., 2019)."

Given these pieces of evidence:

### Answer: Yes
Direct Evidence from Report:
- "The device must be portable and lightweight." - "According to Smith et al. [1], a portable and lightweight device is essential for field applications."
- "The device must measure environmental temperature and humidity accurately." - "Accurate measurement is crucial as noted by Doe in [2] to prevent heat-related illnesses."
- "It should provide an alert when critical thresholds are reached (NCDC, 2022)."
- "The system must be easy to operate (John et al., 2019)." 

These instances from the document confirm that every technical requirement is clearly associated with a citation supporting why it should be included.
