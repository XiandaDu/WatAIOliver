No, not every requirement is clearly appropriate for the problem defined in the report.

Direct evidence from the report:
1. The functional requirements listed in the report under "Functional Requirements" are:

    - The device shall weigh less than 0.5 lbs to be easily portable.
    - The device shall have a battery life of at least 8 hours to last a typical workday.
    - The device shall measure ambient temperature, humidity, and heart rate.
    - The device shall alert the user when heat stress is detected.
    - The device shall transmit data to a remote monitoring system.
    - The device shall be water-resistant.

2. In the problem definition section, the primary concern is regarding detecting heat stress to prevent health issues in high-temperature environments.

Relevance:
- Most of the requirements, such as the device's ability to measure ambient temperature, humidity, and heart rate, alert the user, transmit data, and the weight requirement, are appropriate.
- The requirement "The device shall be water-resistant" is not clearly contextualized within the problem definition. Unless the report specifies that the problem environment involves potential exposure to water or high humidity levels that can affect the device, this requirement does not directly correlate with detecting or mitigating heat stress. 

Thus, considering only the functional requirements listed in the document, not all requirements are clearly appropriate for the problem defined in the report.
