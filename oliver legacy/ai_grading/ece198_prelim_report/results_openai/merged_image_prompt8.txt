### Standard Consideration 1:
**The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totaling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated.**

**Yes/No: Yes**

**Direct Evidence:**
1. Principle/Standard 1: "The principle of heat exchange and thermodynamics" - Mentioned in the introduction section.
2. Principle/Standard 2: "Thermistor: A temperature-sensitive resistor" - Clearly stated in the 'Components' section.
3. Principle/Standard 3: "ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion)" - Explained in the 'Components' section.

These principles are explicitly mentioned within the report, meeting the requirement.

### Standard Consideration 2:
**The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totaling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated. Is every such principle/standard that was included associated with a clear, accurate description of what it is and why it was included, along with a citation to support the claims?**

**Yes/No: No**

**Direct Evidence:**
1. Principle/Standard 1: "The principle of heat exchange and thermodynamics" is mentioned with a broad description on how it applies to the design but lacks detailed citations supporting the claims.
2. Principle/Standard 2: "Thermistor: A temperature-sensitive resistor" is clearly defined and included with its application, but does not include a citation.
3. Principle/Standard 3: "ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion)". While the function of the ADC is described, there is no specific citation provided.

### Standard Consideration 3:
**The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totaling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated. If a principle is applied, an equation must be provided. If a standard is applied, the relevant section of the standard must be included.**

**Yes/No: No**

**Direct Evidence:**

1. Principle/Standard 1: "The principle of heat exchange and thermodynamics" is mentioned, but there is no specific equation provided in the report.
2. Principle/Standard 2: "Thermistor: A temperature-sensitive resistor" has an explanation, but there is no accompanying equation.
3. Principle/Standard 3: "ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion)" explains the functionality, but there
