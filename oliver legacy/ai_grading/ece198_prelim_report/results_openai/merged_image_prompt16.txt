No, not every requirement is clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included. Here is the direct evidence from the report:

- In the "Introduction" section, several technical requirements are mentioned without citations, such as the need for a heat stress detector.
- Under "List of Features," features like "lightweight," "water-resistant," "noise and vibration resistant," and "low power consumption" are listed without direct citations to support their inclusion.
- The "Design Proposal" section mentions the use of specific sensors and components (e.g., temperature sensor, humidity sensor) but does not provide corresponding citations for each component selection.
  
Without these requirements being clearly associated with citations explaining their necessity, the criterion is not fully met.
