Yes.

**Direct evidence from the report:**
- **Technical Requirements:** 
  The section titled "Technical requirements" in the document lists specific technical requirements:
  - "The device should read the temperature and humidity with acceptable accuracy."
  - "It should be able to wirelessly transmit the data to a central system."
  - "The battery life should last for at least 24 hours on a single charge."
  - "The device should include a display to show the user the current status and readings."

- **Functional Requirements:**
  The section titled "Functional requirements" in the document lists specific functional requirements:
  - "The device should notify users when the temperature or humidity exceeds safe limits."
  - "It should be easy to attach to clothing."
  - "The data collected should be easily accessed and analyzed by users."

This clear distinction and listing of both types of requirements confirm that the report meets the standard of distinguishing between "technical requirements" and "functional requirements."
