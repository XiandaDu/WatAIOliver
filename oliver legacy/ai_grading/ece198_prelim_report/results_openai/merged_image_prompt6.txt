**Standard 1: Technical Requirements must have Quantifiable Measurements with Ranges and Units**

Answer: **No**

**Evidence:**
1. The requirement "The detector must alert whenever the individual's temperature exceeds a certain threshold" has no quantifiable measurement with specific ranges or units provided.
2. The requirement "The detector must be affordable and small enough to be easily worn" also lacks quantifiable measurements. There are no specific dimensions or cost ranges provided.
3. The requirement "It must be reliable and accurate in detecting the individual's temperature" mentions accuracy but does not provide numerical ranges or units.

**Standard 2: Feasibility for First-Semester Engineering Students**

Answer: **No**
 
**Evidence:**
1. The requirement for "accuracy in detecting the individual's temperature within ±0.1°C" seems advanced and may require sophisticated equipment and calibration methods that first-semester students might not be proficient in handling.
2. The requirement "must alert whenever the individual's temperature exceeds a certain threshold" involves real-time monitoring and possibly the integration of sensors with alert mechanisms, which could be complex for beginners to implement accurately.
3. Specific requirements on reliability and usability (like affordability and size) will require comprehensive research and possibly advanced design tools which may be beyond the basic practical skills of first-semester students.

**Standard 3: Appropriateness of Requirements for the Defined Problem**

Answer: **Yes**

**Evidence:**
1. The requirement "The detector must alert whenever the individual's temperature exceeds a certain threshold" is directly aligned with the problem of detecting heat stress.
2. The size and affordability requirements ensure that the product is practical and wearable, which is appropriate for the goal of personal heat stress monitoring.
3. The reliability and accuracy in detecting temperature requirements are suitable to ensure the device is effective in real-world conditions, directly addressing the problem of heat stress detection and response.

By providing direct evidence from the report, we can comprehensively evaluate each standard individually.
