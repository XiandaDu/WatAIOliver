No, the report does not clearly describe all stakeholders and why they are interested in the outcomes of the project.

Evidence from the report:
- The only mention of stakeholders is in the section titled "Stakeholders" where it lists "Soldiers, warehouse workers, field workers, athletes, runners, bicyclists etc." While this identifies potential stakeholders, it does not explain why these stakeholders are interested in the outcomes of the project.
