- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Is every requirement clearly appropriate for the problem defined in the report? 
  - Answer: Yes
  - Direct Evidence: 
    - Functional Requirement 1: "The device should measure the temperature and humidity accurately." This is appropriate because the problem defined involves detecting heat stress, which is influenced by temperature and humidity levels.
    - Functional Requirement 2: "The device should alert the user when the heat stress level is high based on predefined thresholds." This is appropriate as providing alerts is crucial for preventing heat-related illnesses.
    - Functional Requirement 3: "The battery life of the device should be at least 24 hours." This is appropriate because users need a reliable device that works throughout the day without frequent recharging.
    - Functional Requirement 4: "The device should be portable and lightweight." This is appropriate because users need a device that is easy to carry around in various environments.

- Consider only the technical requirements listed in the document. Is every requirement clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included? 
  - Answer: No
  - Direct Evidence: 
    - Technical Requirement 1: "The device should use an SHT31 sensor for temperature and humidity measurement." There is no direct citation supporting why this specific sensor should be used.
    - Technical Requirement 2: "The device should have a microcontroller capable of processing multiple sensor inputs." There is no direct citation supporting this requirement either.
    - Technical Requirement 3: "The communication module should support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.0." No direct citation is provided here for why BLE 5.0 is necessary.
    - Technical Requirement 4: "The device should use a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a capacity of at least 1000mAh." There is no citation supporting this specific battery type and capacity.

- Consider only the technical requirements listed in the document. Are there at least four such requirements listed? 
  - Answer: Yes
