**Standard 1: Consider only the technical requirements listed in the document. Every requirement must have an associated measurement. This measurement must be quantifiable numerically, and the report must include a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements.**

**Answer: Yes**

The report provides quantifiable numerical measurements for each technical requirement with relevant units and acceptable ranges. Here are the direct evidences:

1. **Temperature Sensor:**
   - Requirement: "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2°C, the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning."
   - Measurement: Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)
   - Range: 35.6 to 40.6 °C (as mentioned in the functional requirements section)

2. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
   - Requirement: "When heart rates deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute, the microcontroller turns on a blue warning light."
   - Measurement: Heart rate in beats per minute (bpm)
   - Range: 60 to 200 bpm (as mentioned in the functional requirements section)

3. **Ultraviolet (UV) Sensor:**
   - Requirement: "When ultraviolet index of 8 and above is detected by the UV sensor, microcontroller turns on sound (different from the temperature warning) and a yellow light warning."
   - Measurement: Ultraviolet index (UVI)
   - Range: 1 to 11 (as mentioned in the functional requirements section)

4. **Warning Speed:**
   - Requirement: "Updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus, faster than human reaction speed."
   - Measurement: Time in milliseconds (ms)
   - Range: Less than 150 ms
