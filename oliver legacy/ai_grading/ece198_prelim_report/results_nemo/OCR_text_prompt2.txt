**Standard 1: Is there a statement that clearly defines the problem experienced by the customer?**

**Answer:** Yes.

**Evidence from the report:**

In the "Customer problem" section, the report states:

"As global temperatures continue to reach new highs in 2023, farm workers across Canada are at increasing risk of suffering from heat stress [1], [2]. Heat stroke, a common aspect of heat stress, is often caused by a combination of exposure to hot environments and over-exertion through physical activity [3]."

This statement clearly defines the problem experienced by the customer (farm workers) as heat stress, with heat stroke being a common and serious consequence. The problem is backed up by two citations (1 and 2) that directly reference the defined problem.
