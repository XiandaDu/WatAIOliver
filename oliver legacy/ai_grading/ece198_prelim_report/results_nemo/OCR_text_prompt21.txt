**Consider only the technical requirements listed in the document. Is every requirement clearly associated with a citation that supports why it should be included? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer.**

**Answer:** No.

**Evidence:**
- The technical requirement "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning" is not associated with any citation.
- The technical requirement "When the electrocardiogram reads heart rates that deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute, the microcontroller turns on a blue warning light" is not associated with any citation.
- The technical requirement "When ultraviolet index of 8 and above is detected by the UV sensor, microcontroller turns on sound (different from the temperature warning) and a yellow light warning" is not associated with any citation.
- The technical requirement "Updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus, faster than human reaction speed" is not associated with any citation.
