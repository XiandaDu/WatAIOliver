**Safety is extremely important for any engineering work. Does the report include clear safety requirements, and are those requirements adequate for the problem?**

**Answer:** Yes, the report includes clear safety requirements. Here are the direct evidence from the report:

1. **Power consumption limit:**
   - "No more than 30W of power (in any form) may be consumed, transferred, discharged or expended at any point in time."

2. **Energy storage limit:**
   - "The project must not store more than 500mJ of energy (in any form) at any point in time."

3. **Electrical insulation:**
   - "Electrical insulation will be applied."

These requirements are adequate for the problem as they ensure the device does not pose electrical hazards to the user. The power consumption limit prevents the device from drawing too much power, which could lead to overheating or other safety issues. The energy storage limit ensures that even if the device fails, it cannot store enough energy to cause harm. Electrical insulation protects the user from electrical shocks.

However, the report does not explicitly address other potential safety hazards such as mechanical safety (e.g., sharp edges, moving parts), environmental safety (e.g., chemical exposure), or software safety (e.g., data security, privacy). Therefore, while the report does include clear safety requirements, they are not exhaustive and could be expanded to cover a broader range of potential safety hazards.
