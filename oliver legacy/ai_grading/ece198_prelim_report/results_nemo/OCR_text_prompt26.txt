**Standard 1: The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totalling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated.**

- **Standard deviation**: Yes, the report clearly states the use of standard deviation to measure deviations in the user's heart rate. The formula for calculating standard deviation is provided: \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \]
- **Systems of linear equations**: Yes, the report mentions the use of systems of linear equations to model body temperature trends. The general form of a linear equation is given: \[ y = mx + b \]
- **Inequality**: Yes, the report discusses the use of inequality to set ranges for temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index. An example of an inequality is given: \[ x < 5, x > 5 \]

The report explicitly states and applies three different principles, meeting the first standard.
