**Standard 1: The report is required to include three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or some combination totalling at least three. These principles or standards must be clearly and explicitly stated.**

**Answer:** Yes, the report clearly states three principles/standards.

1. **Mathematical Principle - Standard Deviation:**
   - Direct evidence: "The project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation, which indicates how data is dispersed around the mean [18]. Deviations in the user's heart rate will be measured by the microcontroller, which will issue a warning to the user if the deviation reaches a certain threshold. Standard deviation is computed with the following formula: \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \]"

2. **Mathematical Principle - Systems of Linear Equations:**
   - Direct evidence: "Additionally, the project will use mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations. Systems of linear equations consist of multiple equations in the form: \[ y = mx + b \text{ [19]} \] By modeling body temperature trends with linear equations, we can predict when the user's body temperature will reach an unsafe level and offer an early warning if there is a sudden increase."

3. **Engineering Standard - Safety Requirements (Power and Energy Limits):**
   - Direct evidence: "Safety requirements [...] - No more than 30W of power (in any form) may be consumed, transferred, discharged or expended at any point in time - The project must not store more than 500mJ of energy (in any form) at any point in time"

These principles/standards are explicitly stated and play a significant role in the project's functionality and safety.
