The report clearly associates each technical requirement with a citation that supports its inclusion. For instance:

1. The requirement to measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature is supported by citation [10].
2. The heart rate measurement requirement citing a range of 60 to 200 beats per minute is backed by citation [11].
3. The ultraviolet index measurement requirement is referenced with citation [12].

Each requirement is explicitly linked to relevant citations, affirming that they are well-supported in the document.
