The report includes three clear scientific and mathematical principles that contribute to solving the problem. The principles are:

1. **Standard Deviation**: The report states, "The project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation, which indicates how data is dispersed around the mean." This principle is explained as a way to measure deviations in the user's heart rate, issuing a warning if the deviation reaches a certain threshold.

2. **Linear Equations**: The report mentions, "Additionally, the project will use mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations." This is explained in the context of predicting body temperature trends to offer early warnings if unsafe levels are detected.

3. **Inequality**: The report outlines, "The final mathematical principle this project would make use of is inequality." It explains that inequality functions will be used to set expected ranges for quantities like temperature and heart rate, triggering warnings when these quantities exceed their set ranges.

Each principle is clearly stated and accompanied by a reasonable explanation of how it contributes to addressing the problem of heat stress detection among farm workers.
