The technical requirements outlined in the report are clearly appropriate for the problem defined. 

1. Measuring body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius is critical, as it allows for monitoring of physiological indicators of heat stress. The requirement to warn the user when the temperature exceeds 37.2Â°C is appropriate and directly addresses the concern of heat stroke, which is a key issue for farm workers.

2. The requirement to measure heart rate within a range of 60 to 200 beats per minute also fits the context. By warning the user of over-exertion, it mitigates risks associated with excessive physical activity under high temperatures.

3. The ultraviolet index measurement requirement, which warns users at an index of 8 and above, is relevant as it helps prevent sunburn and related skin issues due to UV exposure, which is common for farm workers in sunny environments.

Overall, the report establishes a clear link between the defined technical requirements and the identified problem of heat stress among farm workers, ensuring that each requirement is relevant and necessary.
