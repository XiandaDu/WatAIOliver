The report does not meet the criterion that every functional requirement must have an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically, with a range of values and relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. 

For example:
- The requirement to "Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius" specifies a range but lacks an explicit numeric measurement associated with how the measurement is taken or defined in a way that indicates acceptable accuracy or error margins. 
- Similarly, while the heart rate and ultraviolet index have ranges specified, the report does not detail how these measurements are quantified or the acceptable tolerances for inaccuracies. 

Thus, not every functional requirement in the document meets the specified criterion.
