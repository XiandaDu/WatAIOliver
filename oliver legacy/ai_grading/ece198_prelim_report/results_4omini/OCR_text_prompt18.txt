The technical requirements listed in the report do not meet the criterion that every requirement must have an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically and includes a range of values with relevant units. Specifically, the following technical requirements lack clear ranges with acceptable measurements:

1. The requirement regarding the temperature sensor states: "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C...," but it does not specify an upper limit for acceptable body temperature before a warning is issued.
2. For the electrocardiogram, it states: "When the electrocardiogram reads heart rates that deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute," but it does not define what constitutes an acceptable heart rate range for the user population.
3. The ultraviolet index requirement mentions: "When ultraviolet index of 8 and above is detected..." but does not provide a specified lower limit or an acceptable value range. 

These points indicate that not every technical requirement meets the standard of having a measurable range.
