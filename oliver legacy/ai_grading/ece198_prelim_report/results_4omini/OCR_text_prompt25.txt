The report includes three scientific principles, which are clearly stated and associated with accurate descriptions. The principles mentioned are:

1. **Standard Deviation**: The report states that "the project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation, which indicates how data is dispersed around the mean." This principle is supported with the description of its application to alert users based on deviations in heart rate.

2. **Systems of Linear Equations**: The report mentions that "the project will use mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations," specifically in modeling body temperature trends. This principle is also clearly explained in the context of predicting unsafe body temperature levels.

3. **Inequality**: The report describes the use of inequality functions in determining when warnings should be issued based on detected quantities exceeding set thresholds. The principle is explained with the statement, "We would assign a variable to the standard/expected ranges of our quantities (temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index)."

For each of these principles, the descriptions articulate what they are and why they are included in the project, effectively meeting the required standard.
