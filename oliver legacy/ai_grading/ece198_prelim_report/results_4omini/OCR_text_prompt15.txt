The functional requirements listed in the report are clearly appropriate for the problem defined. For example, the requirement to "measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature" directly addresses the risk of heat stress and heat-related illnesses that farm workers face. Similarly, "measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warn the user of over-exertion" is essential for detecting signs of heat illness, which aligns with the projectâ€™s goal to protect farm workers' health. Each functional requirement is specific to the needs identified in the customer problem section and clearly relates to the overall objective of the project.
