The report includes three explicit mathematical principles that are clearly stated:

1. **Standard Deviation**: The report states that "the project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation, which indicates how data is dispersed around the mean." The formula provided is \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \].

2. **Systems of Linear Equations**: The report mentions the use of "mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations," and provides the equation \( y = mx + b \).

3. **Inequality Functions**: The report notes, "inequality functions can be given such as \( x < 5, x > 5 \)," explaining that variables will be assigned to standard ranges of the monitored quantities.

Each principle is explicitly stated and includes the corresponding equations, thus meeting the requirements.
