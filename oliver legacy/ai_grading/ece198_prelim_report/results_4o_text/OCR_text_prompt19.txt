The report indicates that the technical requirements include specific numerical measurements for body temperature, heart rate, and UV index which first-semester engineering students could feasibly measure using appropriate sensors and devices (temperature sensor, electrocardiogram, UV sensor). However, there are certain measurements and principles like the computation of deviations in heart rate and inequality functions guiding the measurements that might be complex for first-semester students to practically implement without sophisticated skills and adequate guidance. For example:

- “Deviations in the user's heart rate will be measured by the microcontroller, which will issue a warning to the user if the deviation reaches a certain threshold.” This involves understanding and applying the standard deviation formula.
  
- The quick response times specified (updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds) might be technically challenging for beginners to achieve reliably.

Hence, while many of the numerical measurements are straightforward, the overall feasibility for first-semester students is questionable considering these additional complexities.
