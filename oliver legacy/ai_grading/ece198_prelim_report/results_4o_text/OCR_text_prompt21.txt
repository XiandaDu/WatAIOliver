Direct evidence from the report supports the association of every technical requirement with a corresponding citation:

1. **Temperature sensor reading greater than 37.2°C:** Supported by citation [15].
   - "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2°C, the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning [15]."

2. **Heart rates that deviate more than 23 beats per minute:** Supported by citations [3] and [16].
   - "When the electrocardiogram reads heart rates that deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute, the microcontroller turns on a blue warning light [3][16]."

3. **Ultraviolet index (UV) of 8 and above:** Supported by citation [11].
   - "When ultraviolet index of 8 and above is detected by the UV sensor, the microcontroller turns on sound (different from the temperature warning) and a yellow light warning [11]."

4. **Warnings within 150 milliseconds:** Supported by citation [17].
   - "Updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus, faster than human reaction speed [17]."

These citations adequately support the inclusion of the technical requirements listed in the report.
