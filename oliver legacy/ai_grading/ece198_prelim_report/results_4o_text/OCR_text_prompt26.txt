The report mentions three mathematical principles and provides corresponding equations for each:
1. Calculation of standard deviation, with the equation:
   \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} \]

2. Solving systems of linear equations, with the generic form of equation given as:
   \[ y = mx + b \]

3. Use of inequality functions with examples provided:
   \[ x < 5, x > 5 \]

All principles are clearly stated and supported by appropriate mathematical equations, meeting the required criterion.
