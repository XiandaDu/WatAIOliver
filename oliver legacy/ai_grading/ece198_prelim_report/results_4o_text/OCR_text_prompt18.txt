The report outlines technical requirements, but not all of them meet the criteria of having a quantifiable measurement with a range of values and relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. Here is the evidence:

1. **Temperature Detection:**
   - Requirement: "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning [15]."
   - Problem: Does not provide a range of acceptable measurements, only a threshold.

2. **Heart Rate Detection:**
   - Requirement: "When the electrocardiogram reads heart rates that deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute, the microcontroller turns on a blue warning light [3][16]."
   - Problem: Specifies a threshold for deviation but does not provide a range of acceptable heart rates.

3. **UV Index Detection:**
   - Requirement: "When ultraviolet index of 8 and above is detected by the UV sensor, microcontroller turns on sound (different from the temperature warning) and a yellow light warning [11]."
   - Problem: Again, specifies a threshold but not a range of acceptable measurements.

4. **Update Speed:**
   - Requirement: "Updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus, faster than human reaction speed [17]."
   - Problem: This is a performance requirement but lacks a range and relevant units for measurement. 

As demonstrated, these technical requirements do not include acceptable measurement ranges or fully adhere to the criterion of being numerically quantifiable with ranges.
