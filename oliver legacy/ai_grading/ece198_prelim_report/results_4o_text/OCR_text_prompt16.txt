<answer>no</answer>

The provided functional requirements are as follows:

- Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of high body temperature [10]
- Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warns user of over-exertion [11]
- Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11, the full range of the scale, providing warnings for potential sunburn [12]
- Displays light warnings between 150 and 200 millicandelas (luminous intensity of hobby LEDs) and sound warnings of at least 70 decibels (like an alarm clock) are produced [13][14]

Here is the analysis regarding whether each requirement is clearly associated with a citation supporting its inclusion:

1. **Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of high body temperature [10]**:
    - The report includes a citation [10], which specifically addresses body temperature ranges.

2. **Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warns user of over-exertion [11]**:
    - The requirement is associated with citation [11], which supports heart rate ranges.

3. **Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11, the full range of the scale, providing warnings for potential sunburn [12]**:
    - This requirement has a citation [12] that supports the ultraviolet index range.

4. **Displays light warnings between 150 and 200 millicandelas (luminous intensity of hobby LEDs) and sound warnings of at least 70 decibels (like an alarm clock) are produced [13][14]**:
    - This requirement involves two elements: light intensity and sound intensity. The citations [13] and [14] support each element respectively.

However, for requirements such as "standards of luminous intensity" and "sound warnings," general standards are discussed without a specific citation supporting the necessity of those exact values for the functional requirements of this particular project on heat stress.

Therefore, while some requirements do have citations associated with their inclusion ([10], [11], [12]), not all elements of the luminous and sound warning requirements have clear citations that support why they should be included, resulting in the overall answer being 'no'.
