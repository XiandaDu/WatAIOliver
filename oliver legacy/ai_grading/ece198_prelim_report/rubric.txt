- The assignment distinguishes between "technical requirements" and "functional requirements". Are both types of requirements present in the document? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer. You must provide direct evidence from the report. Do not make anything up or infer anything.
- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Ignore technical and safety requirements. Are there at least four such requirements listed? Answer 'yes' or 'no'. Do not produce any other output.
- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Ignore technical and safety requirements.  Every requirement must have an associated measurement. This measurement must be quantifiable numerically, and the report must include a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. Does every functional requirement in the document meet this criterion? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer. You must provide direct evidence from the report. Do not make anything up or infer anything.
- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Ignore technical and safety requirements.  Every requirement must have an associated measurement. This measurement must be quantifiable numerically, and the report must include a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. This project will be performed by first-semester engineering students, who may lack sophisticated skills of a professional. In your opinion, is it feasible for such students to perform these measurements for every functional requirement?Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer. You must provide direct evidence from the report. Do not make anything up or infer anything.
