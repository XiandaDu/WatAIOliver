The report clearly presents functional requirements associated with citations that support their inclusion. For example, the requirement to measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature is supported by citation [10]. Similarly, the requirement to measure heart rate with associated warnings is supported by citation [11], and the measurement of ultraviolet index with corresponding warnings is supported by citation [12]. Each functional requirement is clearly identified and has an appropriate citation backing it up.
