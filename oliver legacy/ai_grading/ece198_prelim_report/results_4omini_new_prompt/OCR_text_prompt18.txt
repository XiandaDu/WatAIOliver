The report does not meet the standard that every technical requirement must have an associated quantifiable measurement with a range of values and relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. 

For example, in the technical requirements section: 
- "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2°C..." lacks a defined upper limit for acceptable body temperature. While it specifies turning on a warning for temperatures above 37.2°C, it does not provide an upper range of body temperature in degrees Celsius.
- "When the electrocardiogram reads heart rates that deviate from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute..." also does not specify an acceptable range for heart rates beyond deviations, leaving the requirement incomplete.

Because the report lacks comprehensive ranges for these measurements, it fails to meet the specified criterion regarding technical requirements.
