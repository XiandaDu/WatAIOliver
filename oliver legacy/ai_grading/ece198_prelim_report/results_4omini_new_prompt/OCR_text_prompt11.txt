The report indeed distinguishes between "technical requirements" and "functional requirements." 

**Functional requirements** are outlined under a dedicated section titled "Functional requirements" and include criteria such as the device's ability to measure body temperature and heart rate, and provide warnings based on specific thresholds. For instance, it states: "Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of high body temperature [10]."

**Technical requirements**, which are detailed in a separate section titled "Technical requirements," include specific criteria for how the device operates under certain conditions. An example provided is: "When the temperature sensor reads a body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, the microcontroller turns on the sound and a red light warning [15]."

Thus, both types of requirements are present in the document.
