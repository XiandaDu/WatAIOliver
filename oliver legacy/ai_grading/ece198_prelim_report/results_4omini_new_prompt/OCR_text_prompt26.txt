The report includes the following scientific and mathematical principles, each of which is clearly stated and accompanied by relevant equations:

1. **Standard Deviation**: The report states that "the project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation," and the formula provided is:
   \[
   \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}
   \]

2. **Systems of Linear Equations**: It states, "the project will use mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations," followed by the equation for a linear equation:
   \[
   y = mx + b
   \]

3. **Inequality**: The report mentions using inequality functions and includes examples:
   \[
   x < 5, x > 5
   \]

Each of these principles has been clearly stated and supported with an equation, fulfilling the requirement to include at least three principles or standards with explicit statements and calculations.
