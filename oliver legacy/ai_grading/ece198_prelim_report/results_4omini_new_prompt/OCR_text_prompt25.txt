The report includes three mathematical principles, which are explicitly stated and associated with clear, accurate descriptions of what they are and why they were included. The principles mentioned include:

1. **Standard Deviation**: It is explained that "the calculation of standard deviation indicates how data is dispersed around the mean." The report goes on to show the formula used for calculation.

2. **Systems of Linear Equations**: The description states that these equations are used for "modeling body temperature trends," which helps in predicting when the user's body temperature may reach an unsafe level.

3. **Inequality**: The report notes that inequalities will be used to set ranges for temperature, heart rate deviation, and UV index, indicating when warnings are issued.

Each principle is supported by citations (e.g., reference [18] for standard deviation, [19] for systems of linear equations, and [20] for inequalities). Thus, every principle that was included is associated with a clear and accurate description, along with citations to support the claims.
