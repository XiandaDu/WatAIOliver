The report includes three mathematical principles that are clearly and explicitly stated: 

1. **Standard Deviation**: The report describes how standard deviation is calculated and states its relevance to measuring deviations in the user's heart rate, which is supported by the citation [18].
   
2. **Systems of Linear Equations**: It discusses the use of linear equations to model body temperature trends, helping to predict unsafe levels, and cites source [19] for this principle.

3. **Inequality**: The concept of inequality is briefly explained, detailing how it will be used to manage standard/expected ranges for temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index, with citation [20] included.

Each of these principles is accompanied by a clear, accurate description of what it is and its significance to the project, along with valid citations to support the claims made.
