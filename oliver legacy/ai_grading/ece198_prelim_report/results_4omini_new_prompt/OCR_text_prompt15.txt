The report lists functional requirements that are appropriate for the problem defined, which is to protect farm workers from heat stress. For example, the requirement to "measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warn the user of high body temperature" directly addresses the need to monitor and alert users about potential heat stroke, which is a critical aspect of heat stress (Functional Requirement #1). Additionally, the requirement to "measure heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warn the user of over-exertion" supports the goal of preventing health risks associated with strenuous physical activity under high temperatures (Functional Requirement #2). Lastly, the requirement to "measure ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11 and provide warnings for potential sunburn" is relevant as it helps protect workers from UV radiation, which is another factor associated with heat stress (Functional Requirement #3).
