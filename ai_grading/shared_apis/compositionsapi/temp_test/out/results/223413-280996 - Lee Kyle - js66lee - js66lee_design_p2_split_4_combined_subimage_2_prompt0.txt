# Project 2: Hashing

## 4. Test Cases

It is important to test edge cases to confirm all functions are working as expected.

### Open Addressing:

- **Capacity Test:** Insert a new key into the full table
- **Collision Test:** Insert a key that the result of primary hashing gives collision (secondary hash function should be called and find the appropriate index to insert the key)
- **Duplication Test:** Insert a key that is already in the table
- **Deletion Test:** Delete a key that is in the table or not in the table
- **Search Test:** Search for a key that is in the table, not in the table or deleted from the table
