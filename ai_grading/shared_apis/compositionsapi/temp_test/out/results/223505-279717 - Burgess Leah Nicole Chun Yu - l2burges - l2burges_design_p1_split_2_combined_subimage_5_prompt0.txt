# Time Complexity:

- push_front, push_back, pop_front, and pop_back are all O(1) constant time.
- push_front, push_back, pop_front, and pop_back only add to or delete the front or back of the deque, making it constant time.
- front and back checks if the deque is empty, if it is not, they return the front and back url making it constant time.
- Size and empty check if the current size of the deque is zero and then returns an appropriate statement, making it constant time.

Find, print, and clear functions are all O(n) time complexity. Find, print, and clear iterate through the deque at most linearly once, making it O(n).
