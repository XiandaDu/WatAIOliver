# Double Hashing:

- Tested to create a hash table of size x
- Tested inserting multiple elements, including inserting when the hash table is full (expect failure), inserting when there is a collision using first hash function and collisions using secondary hash function, and inserting the same student number that has already been inserted (expect failure).
- Tested searching for students that were in the hashtable (expect success) and those that weren't (expect failure). As well, tested searching for a student that was inserted and has since been deleted (expect failure).
- Tested deleting students that were in the hashtable (expect success) and those that weren't (expect failure). As well, tested deleting the same student twice (expect success on the first attempt and failure on the second).
