- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Are there at least four such requirements listed? Answer 'yes' or 'no'. Do not produce any other output.
  - Yes.

- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Every requirement must have an associated measurement. This measurement must be quantifiable numerically, and the report must include a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. Does every functional requirement in the document meet this criterion? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer. You must provide direct evidence from the report. Do not make anything up or infer anything.
  - No. Evidence from the report: 
    1. Accuracy of the temperature sensor ("±0.5°C over the range of 35°C to 42°C").
    2. Accuracy of the humidity sensor is not defined with a quantifiable range or unit.
    3. Threshold for heat stress alert is not defined with a quantifiable range or unit.
    4. Battery life is defined ("must last for at least 8 hours of continuous operation").

- Consider only the functional requirements listed in the document. Every requirement must have an associated measurement. This measurement must be quantifiable numerically, and the report must include a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements. This project will be performed by first-semester engineering students, who may lack sophisticated skills of a professional. In your opinion, is it feasible for such students to perform these measurements for every functional requirement? Answer 'yes' or 'no' and provide direct evidence from the report to support your answer. You must provide direct evidence from the report. Do not make anything up or infer anything.
  - Yes. Evidence from the report:
    - The document mentions using pre-calibrated sensors, which suggests that students do not have to be skilled in calibration as they can rely on off-the-shelf components:
      - "The system must use a pre-calibrated temperature sensor with an accuracy of ±0.5°C over the range of 35°C to 42°C."
      - "Sensors must be pre-calibrated to ensure accuracy and reduce the need for additional calibration efforts by students."
    - Measurement of battery life ("must last for at least 8 hours of continuous operation") can be done by simple observation and timing, which is within the capabilities of first-semester engineering students.
