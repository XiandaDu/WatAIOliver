No, not every technical requirement in the document meets the specified criterion.

Direct evidence from the report:

1. Under "Technical Requirements," one of the requirements is:
   - **Bulleted requirement:**
     "The detector should be able to measure temperature precisely."
   - This requirement does not provide a quantifiable numerical measurement or a range of values with relevant units indicating acceptable measurements.

2. Another example under "Technical Requirements":
   - **Bulleted requirement:**
     "The device needs to be portable and durable."
   - This statement is qualitative and lacks a quantifiable numerical measurement or range with units.

These examples highlight that not all technical requirements in the document meet the criterion of having an associated measurement that is quantifiable numerically, with a range of values and relevant units indicating acceptable measurements.
