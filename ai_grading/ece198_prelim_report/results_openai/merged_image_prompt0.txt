### Standard 1: Is there a statement that clearly defines who the customer or group who will be impacted is?

**Answer: Yes**

**Evidence:**
The report states, "This device would be useful for farmers, construction workers, people who work in mines, and high loaders" (Introduction section, first paragraph). This clearly defines the customers or groups who will be impacted by the heat stress detector.

### Standard 2: Are there in-text citations to help support how the customer is defined?

**Answer: No**

**Evidence:**
In the statements defining the customers, such as "This device would be useful for farmers, construction workers, people who work in mines, and high loaders," there are no in-text citations provided to support this definition in the introduction section or elsewhere in the report.

### Standard 3: Is there a statement that clearly defines the problem experienced by the customer? The statement must be backed up by at least two citations that directly reference the defined problem.

**Answer: No**

**Evidence:**
While the problem of heat stress is mentioned in various parts of the report, such as in "Heat stress is a common problem faced by people working under high temperatures" (Introduction section, second paragraph), there is no single statement that clearly defines the problem experienced by the customer backed up by at least two citations. For instance, the statement in the Introduction section mentioning the problem does not include any citations, and other references to the problem in the "Problem Background" and "Proposed Design" sections do not have the required two citations immediately following it.
