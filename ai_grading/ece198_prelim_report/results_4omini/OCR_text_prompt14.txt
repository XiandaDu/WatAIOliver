The report outlines specific functional requirements with associated measurable ranges for each parameter that the device is intended to monitor. For body temperature, it specifies a measurable range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius. For heart rate, it lists a range of 60 to 200 beats per minute. Additionally, for UV index, it establishes a range from 1 to 11. Each requirement includes measurable quantities that are quantifiable numerically, indicating that it is feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements given that they have clearly defined ranges and units.
