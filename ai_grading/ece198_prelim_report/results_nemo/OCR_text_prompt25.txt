**Standard 1:** Is every such principle/standard that was included associated with a clear, accurate description of what it is and why it was included, along with a citation to support the claims?

- **Standard Deviation:**
  - Description: "The project will make use of mathematical principles through the calculation of standard deviation, which indicates how data is dispersed around the mean."
  - Why: "Deviations in the user's heart rate will be measured by the microcontroller, which will issue a warning to the user if the deviation reaches a certain threshold."
  - Citation: "National Library of Medicine, “Standard Deviation.” nlm.nih.gov. https://www.nlm.nih.gov/oet/ed/stats/02-900.html (accessed Sept. 18, 2023)."
  - **Answer:** Yes, the principle of standard deviation is clearly described, its purpose is explained, and a citation is provided.

- **Systems of Linear Equations:**
  - Description: "The project will use mathematical principles involved in solving systems of linear equations."
  - Why: "By modeling body temperature trends with linear equations, we can predict when the user's body temperature will reach an unsafe level and offer an early warning if there is a sudden increase."
  - Citation: "Math is Fun, “Systems of Linear Equations.” mathisfun.com. https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/systems-linear-equations.html (accessed Sept. 18, 2023)."
  - **Answer:** Yes, the principle of systems of linear equations is clearly described, its purpose is explained, and a citation is provided.

- **Inequality:**
  - Description: "The final mathematical principle this project would make use of is inequality."
  - Why: "When the detected quantity is above the set range, warnings are given."
  - Citation: "Math is Fun, “Definition of Inequality.” mathisfun.com. https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/inequality.html (accessed Sept. 19, 2023)."
  - **Answer:** Yes, the principle of inequality is clearly described, its purpose is explained, and a citation is provided.

- **Engineering Standards (Safety Requirements):**
  - Description: "The project must not store more than 500mJ of energy (in any form) at any point in time."
  -
