The report does not provide quantifiable numerical measurements for every functional requirement. For example, while it mentions that the device should warn the user of over-exertion based on heart rate, it does not specify a range of acceptable heart rates or the exact threshold at which the warning should be triggered. Similarly, it does not provide a specific range for the luminous intensity of the light warnings or the exact decibel level for the sound warnings. Therefore, it is not feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements for every functional requirement based on the information provided in the report.
