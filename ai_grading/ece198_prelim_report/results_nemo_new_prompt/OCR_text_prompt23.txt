<answer>No</answer>

The report does not explicitly state three scientific principles, mathematical principles, engineering standards, or a combination totalling at least three. While it mentions the use of mathematical principles such as standard deviation and solving systems of linear equations, it does not explicitly state any scientific principles or engineering standards. Therefore, the answer is no.
