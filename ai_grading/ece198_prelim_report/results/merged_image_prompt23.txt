Yes, there are three scientific principles clearly stated in the report. The evidence is as follows:

1. **Scientific Principle 1:** The report mentions the principle of heat stress and its effects on farm workers, including symptoms and causes. This is stated in the "Customer problem" section.
   - "As an introduction, temperatures continue to reach new highs in 2023, farm workers across Canada are at increasing risk of suffering from heat stress (1)."

2. **Scientific Principle 2:** The report discusses the principle of heat stroke and its symptoms, which is a medical condition related to heat stress.
   - "Symptoms of heat stroke can include: 1. Rise in body temperature and behavior 2. Abnormal sweat patterns 3. Rapid breathing 4. Nausea and vomiting 5. Rapid heartbeat 6. Headache 7. Dizziness 8. Confusion (9)."

3. **Scientific Principle 3:** The report references the principle of heat exhaustion, another medical condition related to heat stress.
   - "Other aspects of heat stress include heat exhaustion (the body's response to an excessive loss of water and salt, through excessive sweating), and heat cramps (cramps caused by a sudden depletion of water and salt, usually through excessive sweating) and heat syncope (sudden dizziness or fainting caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure)."

These three principles are clearly stated and relevant to the problem being addressed in the report.
