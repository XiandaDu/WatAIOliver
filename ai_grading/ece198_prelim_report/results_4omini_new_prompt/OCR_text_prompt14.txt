The report details quantifiable measurements for each functional requirement. For example, it specifies that the device "Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius," providing clear numerical boundaries. Similarly, it states that it "Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute" and "Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11." Each requirement includes a clear range of values and relevant units, making it feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements based on these numerical standards.
