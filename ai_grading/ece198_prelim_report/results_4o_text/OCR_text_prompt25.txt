<answer>no</answer>

The report includes the following principles:
1. **Calculation of standard deviation**: The report provides a clear description of what standard deviation is and why it is included, supported by a citation [18].
2. **Solving systems of linear equations**: The report explains what linear equations are and their application in predicting body temperature trends, backed by a citation [19].
3. **Inequality functions**: The report gives an example of inequality functions but lacks an adequate description and citation to support it.

For the third principle, the explanation is not as comprehensive and lacks a supporting citation to validate its inclusion. Therefore, not all principles met the requirement of having a clear, accurate description along with a citation.
