Given the functional requirements listed in the report, the project appears to be feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform the measurements. Here is the direct evidence from the report supporting this:

1. **Measuring Body Temperature**: The requirement specifies the device must measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius. These measurements are simple and achievable using off-the-shelf thermal sensors.

2. **Measuring Heart Rate**: The device must measure heart rates in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and provide warnings for over-exertion. The use of common and readily available sensors (e.g., pulse sensors) fits within the capabilities of first-semester students.

3. **Measuring Ultraviolet Index**: The functional requirement indicates a range from 1 to 11 on the ultraviolet index scale. UV sensors that can measure this scale are commercially available and easy to integrate into a project.

4. **Display and Sound Warnings**: The light and sound warnings need to be within the range of 150 to 200 millicandelas for light and at least 70 decibels for sound. Standard hobbyist LEDs and basic buzzers or speakers can meet these requirements and are straightforward to implement.

These measurements and the components required correspond to accessible educational materials and available hardware, making the project feasible for the students.
