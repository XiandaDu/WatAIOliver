The technical requirements listed in the document are clearly appropriate for the problem defined in the report. The problem is to mitigate heat stress for farm workers, and the technical requirements directly address this issue. Specifically:

- The requirement for the temperature sensor to turn on warnings for high body temperature directly addresses the need to avoid heat stroke (a primary goal mentioned in the report).
- The heart rate monitoring requirement ensures warning for over-exertion, which is crucial to prevent heat-related illnesses.
- The UV sensor requirement with warnings for high UV index helps in managing the risk of sunburn.
  
These technical requirements are aligned with the need to measure physiological and environmental parameters that contribute to heat stress and to provide timely warnings to the users, as described in the customer problem section.
