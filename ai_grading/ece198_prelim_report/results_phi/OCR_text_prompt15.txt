 <answer>yes</answer>\n\nThe report \"Heat Stress Detector\" clearly addresses the functional requirements listed in the document. Each requirement is directly linked to a specific problem defined in the report, which is the risk of heat stress for farm workers in Ontario. Here is the evidence from the report:\n\n1. Measures body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius and warns user of high body temperature: The report states that the device will measure body temperature and warn the user if it exceeds 37.2°C. This directly addresses the problem of heat stroke caused by high body temperature.\n\n2. Measures heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute and warns user of over-exertion: The report mentions that the device will measure heart rate and warn the user if there is a deviation from the mean of the previous 15 minutes by more than 23 beats per minute. This directly addresses the problem of heat stroke caused by over-exertion.\n\n3. Measures ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11 and warns user of potential sunburn: The report states that the device will measure the ultraviolet index and warn the user if it exceeds 8. This directly addresses the problem of sunburn caused by excessive UV exposure.\n\n4. Displays light warnings between 150 and 200 millicandelas and sound warnings of at least 70 decibels: The report mentions that the device will produce a red warning light and a sound warning if the body temperature exceeds 37.2°C. This directly addresses the problem of heat stroke caused by high body temperature.\n\n5. Updates and provides warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus: The report states that the device will provide warnings within 150 milliseconds of a change in stimulus. This directly addresses the problem of heat stroke caused by over-exertion and excessive UV exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, the report \"Heat Stress Detector\" clearly addresses the functional requirements listed in the document and is appropriate for the problem defined in the report.\n\n\n"}
