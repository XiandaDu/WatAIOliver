 <answer>yes</answer>\n\nThe report includes three scientific principles, mathematical principles, and engineering standards, which are clearly and explicitly stated. \n\n1. Scientific principles:\n   a. Heat stress and its effects on the human body (Introduction, Symptoms of heat stroke, and other aspects of heat stress)\n   b. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its effects on the human body (Symptoms of sunburn)\n   c. Heart rate and its relation to over-exertion (Symptoms of over-exertion)\n\n2. Mathematical principles:\n   a. Standard deviation (Principles section)\n   b. Systems of linear equations (Principles section)\n   c. Inequality (Principles section)\n\n3. Engineering standards:\n   a. Safety requirements (Safety requirements section)\n   b. Technical requirements (Technical requirements section)\n   c. Functional requirements (Functional requirements section)\n\nFor each principle or standard mentioned in the report, a reasonable explanation is given for how it will contribute to solving the problem of heat stress for farm workers.\n\nFor example, the standard deviation principle will help measure deviations in the user's heart rate and issue a warning if the deviation reaches a certain threshold. The systems of linear equations principle will help model body temperature trends and predict when the user's body temperature will reach an unsafe level. The inequality principle will assign a variable to the standard/expected ranges of quantities (temperature, heart rate deviation, and ultraviolet index) and issue warnings when the detected quantity is above the set range.\n\nThe safety, technical, and functional requirements are also clearly stated and explained in the report.\n\nIn conclusion, the report meets the standard of including three scientific principles, mathematical principles, and engineering standards, and each principle or standard is clearly and explicitly stated with a reasonable explanation for how it will contribute to solving the problem.\n\n\n"}
