 <answer>yes</answer> The report provided by Nathan Jiang and Oluwatise Okusanaya for the \"Heat Stress Detector\" project includes specific technical requirements with associated measurements that are quantifiable numerically. Each requirement is accompanied by a range of values with relevant units, indicating acceptable measurements. For instance, the body temperature is to be measured in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the range of 60 to 200 beats per minute, and the ultraviolet index ranging from 1 to 11. These requirements are clearly stated and meet the criteria of having associated measurements that are quantifiable numerically with a range of values and relevant units. Therefore, it is feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements for every technical requirement, given that the project proposal outlines a clear and quantifiable approach to addressing each requirement.\n"}
