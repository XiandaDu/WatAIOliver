The report does not provide any measurements for the technical requirements. It only states the ranges for the measurements but does not provide any specific values or a method to determine if a measurement is acceptable. For example, it states that the device should measure body temperature in the range of 35.6 to 40.6 degrees Celsius, but it does not provide a specific value for what would be considered an acceptable measurement within that range. Therefore, it is not feasible for first-semester engineering students to perform these measurements for every technical requirement as the report stands.
