The report clearly states that the device should measure body temperature, heart rate, and ultraviolet index, and provide warnings based on these measurements. These requirements are directly related to the problem defined in the report, which is to mitigate the danger of heat stress for farm workers. The specific thresholds for warnings (e.g., body temperature greater than 37.2Â°C, heart rate deviation of more than 23 beats per minute, ultraviolet index of 8 and above) are also clearly defined and appropriate for the problem.
